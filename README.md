# Data Warehouse Project – End-to-End Implementation

Introduction
I was truly inspired by the Data Warehouse Project by @Baraa Khatib Salkini! 🔥 His structured approach helped me understand the different phases of building a data warehouse, and I decided to replicate the project to gain hands-on experience.

Working on this project was an amazing learning experience, as I got to explore how data moves from raw sources to a well-structured data warehouse, making it ready for analysis and business intelligence. In this post, I will walk through the steps I followed, the challenges I faced, and what I learned along the way.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate real-world data engineering workflows, including:
✔️ Data Ingestion from multiple sources
✔️ ETL Pipelines for transforming and cleaning data
✔️ Star Schema Modeling for optimized reporting
✔️ BI & Analytics to enable insights for business users

This repository contains SQL scripts, ETL pipelines, and data models to help anyone replicate and learn from the project step by step.

# 📖 Tools & Technologies Used 🛠️

The following tools were used to build and manage the Data Warehouse:
SQL Server Express – Lightweight database server for storing and querying data.
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) – GUI tool for managing and interacting with SQL databases.
Git & GitHub – Version control system to track project changes and collaborate.
Draw.io – Used to design data architecture diagrams, data flow models, and schema diagrams.
Notion – Used for project management, organizing tasks, and maintaining documentation.

# Step-by-Step Implementation
This project is divided into seven key phases, each with specific tasks and deliverables:

✅ 1. Understanding Requirements – The First Step
Before starting any project, it is important to know what problem we are solving and what data we are working with. The first step was Requirement Analysis, where I:

Defined the project scope – What is the goal of the data warehouse? What kind of insights should it provide?

Identified data sources – Data can come from different places, such as CSV files, databases, APIs, or even external cloud systems.

Analyzed business needs – Understanding how businesses use data helps in designing the right data models.

By doing this, I made sure that the data warehouse had a clear objective and was structured in a way that met business needs.

✅ 2. Designing the Data Architecture – Using the Medallion Approach
The next step was designing the data warehouse structure. I implemented the Medallion Architecture, which is a three-layered approach:

1️⃣ Bronze Layer (Raw Data Storage)

Stores original, unprocessed data from different sources.

No modifications are made to keep the data in its original form.

2️⃣ Silver Layer (Cleaned & Processed Data)

Data is cleaned, formatted, and standardized.

Inconsistent, missing, or incorrect values are fixed.

3️⃣ Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data)

Stores fully processed, structured data for reports and analytics.

Optimized for fast query performance and business intelligence tools.

This layered approach helped maintain data quality, scalability, and performance throughout the pipeline.

✅ 3. Building the ETL Pipeline – Extract, Transform, Load
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is the heart of a data warehouse. It ensures that data moves smoothly and accurately from the source to the final storage.

Here’s how I built the ETL pipeline:

🔹 Extract – Retrieved data from multiple sources (CSV files, databases, APIs, etc.).
🔹 Transform – Cleaned and modified the data by:

Handling missing values

Standardizing formats

Ensuring data consistency
🔹 Load – Stored the refined data into the correct layers in the data warehouse.

By designing efficient ETL pipelines, I ensured that data flowed seamlessly through the system and was always up-to-date for analysis.

✅ 4. Modeling the Gold Layer – Star Schema Design
Once the data was cleaned and ready, I designed the Gold Layer using Star Schema modeling.

🔹 What is Star Schema?

It is a database design that organizes data into fact and dimension tables.

Fact tables store business events (e.g., sales transactions).

Dimension tables store descriptive details (e.g., customer details, product information).

🔹 Why use Star Schema?

Faster queries – Data is structured in a way that makes reports run quickly.

Easy to understand – Business users and analysts can easily retrieve information.

Optimized for reporting – Works well with BI tools and dashboards.

By implementing Star Schema, I made sure that data was efficiently structured for business intelligence (BI) and reporting needs.

✅ 5. Preparing Data for Analytics
Finally, I made the data ready for use by creating:

🔹 Flat Tables – Stored well-structured data for easy access.
🔹 Aggregated Tables – Pre-computed summaries to improve query speed.
🔹 Views – Pre-defined datasets to make data retrieval simpler for end-users.

These steps ensured that business analysts and decision-makers could quickly access insights without dealing with complex queries.

#Key Takeaways & Lessons Learned
After completing this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how data warehouses work. Here are some key lessons I learned:

1️⃣ Data Processing Needs Structure
Breaking down data into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers improves data quality.

Instead of using raw data directly, step-by-step processing ensures that only clean, well-structured data is used in reports.

2️⃣ ETL is the Foundation of a Data Warehouse
ETL pipelines keep data fresh, clean, and accurate.

Optimizing queries, handling large datasets, and using indexing/partitioning techniques help improve performance.

3️⃣ Data Modeling Speeds Up Queries
Using Star Schema made queries faster and easier to run.

Instead of working with complex, unstructured data, business users could quickly analyze trends and make data-driven decisions.

4️⃣ Good Documentation is Essential
Clear documentation of data architecture, ETL workflows, and data models makes maintenance easier.

Using diagrams, naming conventions, and detailed explanations ensures that future improvements can be made without confusion.

Final Thoughts
Working on this Data Warehouse Project has been an eye-opening experience! 🚀

I learned how to:
✅ Design a scalable data warehouse
✅ Build robust ETL pipelines
✅ Optimize data for analytics & reporting
✅ Structure data efficiently using Star Schema

A huge thank you to @Baraa Khatib Salkini for the inspiration and guidance. 🙌 His project breakdown made it easy to follow and understand.

I look forward to applying these skills to real-world data engineering challenges and continuing my journey in Data Warehousing, ETL, and Analytics!
